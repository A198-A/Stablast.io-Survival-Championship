# Introduction
First some simple questions for our reader:
- Tired of Survival Mode only having Barracudas, Shadows X-3 or Odisseys?
- Tired of Survival Mode having only mine traps everywhere?
- Tired of Survival mode having teams of 10 players against you?
- Tired of Survival Mode having to mine for 30 minutes to start combat?
- Tired of Survival Mode not working with Team Mode?
- Tired of Survival Mode sometimes becoming Among Us Mode?
- Tired of Survival Mode becoming boring and long?

Well here we have the solution for these problems ·®ê
# Starblast.io Survival Championship
Also known as Cheap Battle Royale (Which has nothing Cheap in it)

## What's different about it?
In short, a strange combination of Survival Mode, Battle Royale and Dueling

Although if you want a list of the mod's things, well, here you have it:
- You can choose the ships used in the game (Tier 4, Tier 5, etc)
- A system of rounds, one, several or even infinite so that the fun does not end
- Ship selection system
- Spectator mode
- The gravitation field is now replaced by a radiation field (Dueling map edge)
- Includes solo and team mode (Maximum 4) for events and other things
- There are no weapon stores, now you can get them like in Battle Royale
- Mines explode much earlier
- A very nice UI (If the rest of the mod doesn't convince you, the UI does)
- A configuration list to choose the game to your liking (Ships, map, radiation field and more)
